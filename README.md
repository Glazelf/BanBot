# BanBot
Made this specifically for a friend to ban everyone in the server.  
Only truly relevant command is `?banall`, which attempts to ban everyone who isn't a bot, admin or has banning perms.

Most code is straight up copied from my other bot, [Ninigi](https://github.com/Glazelf/NinigiBot/tree/3aa6d22a7d139c081b6eeb5361d112524f0a832f), but with a lot of code removed and the `?banall` command added.
